# EDA_NYCity
In this analysis, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis
(EDA) on the Green Taxi trips data set for January 2022. The
purpose of this analysis is to explore the patterns and trends
in taxi trips for the new year. Specifically, we will examine
the various factors that influence taxi trips, including pick-up
and drop-off locations, trip distance, fare amounts, payment
types, and more.
By analyzing these factors, we hope to gain insights into
the demand for taxi trips in New York City and how these
trips vary by time and location. We also hope to identify any
unique patterns or trends that may be emerging in the Green
Taxi market. Ultimately, this analysis can provide valuable
information for taxi drivers, companies, and policymakers, as
well as anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of
transportation in a bustling city like New York.
